  ## Description
  
  README Generator is a command line javascript application that uses Node.js to generate professional README documents. The user is prompted to input content for the ReadMe and the readme file is written by the application.

  ## Installation 

  Install Node.js on your system. Open the ReadMe generator application via the command line or in visual studio. Enter 'node index.js' into the command line and hit enter. Once all questions have been answered the ReadMe should generate a file and relay a success message to the user.
  
  ## Usage 

  Enter node index.js into the command line. Answer the prompts and press enter each time. The ReadMe will generate and save to the current folder.
